# LLMCrawlBench Dataset

This dataset is part of the artifact for the paper "WebCloak: Characterizing and Mitigating the Threats of LLM-Driven Web Agents as Intelligent Scrapers".

## Overview

To systematically evaluate the LLM-driven web scraping threats, particularly illicit visual asset extraction, we propose LLMCrawlBench, the first large-scale benchmark designed to evaluate the capability of LLM-driven web agents in adversarial image extraction from real-world webpages.

LLMCrawlBench consists of diverse real-world webpages with various visual assets, including protected images, copyrighted content, and sensitive visual information. The dataset is designed to test both the offensive capabilities of LLM-driven web agents and the effectiveness of defensive mechanisms.

## Usage

This dataset can be used in other parts of the defense and evaluation components of the WebCloak artifact.

## Download

The dataset files can be downloaded separately from Google Drive via [this link](https://zenodo.org/records/17251212).

Unzip the dataset as `artifact/` directly inside this `dataset/` folder, e.g., the `99designs` folder should be in `dataset/artifact/99designs`.

## Dataset Structure

The dataset contains benchmark data for evaluating LLM-driven web scraping capabilities and testing defensive mechanisms against adversarial image extraction attacks.
