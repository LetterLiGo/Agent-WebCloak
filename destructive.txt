Only test automated web scraping against local HTML files or websites you own/have permission to scrape,
do not use against live websites without explicit permission. Monitor resource usage as scraping can be
resource-intensive.

Monitor API usage and costs carefully, set API rate limits to prevent runaway costs.

Also be aware that to extract dataset files, you'll probably need 5 GB vacancy in your disk.
